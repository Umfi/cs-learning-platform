## Computer Science Learning Platform

Computer science class in school education
covers a variety of topics (text processing,
coding, data privacy, social aspects, etc.). The
web platform contains all these learning
objectives based on standardized computer
science curricula. An engaging story serves as a
starting point for these objectives. All tasks are
related to the narrative and use gamification
elements to create a learner-friendly
environment. The learning platform should
support both students and teachers in an
educational context via learning, assessment
and scoring.
